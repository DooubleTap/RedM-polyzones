## Natives 
Contains a list of generated natives for RedM, we all know Citizen.InvokeNative is horrible, These functions can be used as wrappers around the this.
- If you don't want to have bloated files and don't mind not having method comments you can use the _Minified.lua version
- If you want to Invoke the natives manually by name you can use the _Headers.lua file, along with Citizen.InvokeNative(N_nativeName)

*Note they are not all guaranteed to work 100%*
